      A <strong>0.7</strong> <a>Draft</a> requires the majority of the text to be nearing its completed form. Vigilance must be maintained to ensure that “feature creep” does not extend beyond the initial vision of the SDR that had been approved by the <abbr>WG</abbr> and <abbr>TAC</abbr>. At this point, the document should be taking the form of completed specification text.

      At this stage, members should be reviewing the text for omissions, errors, or textual corrections. Functionality and features should have been resolved into workable text, and major changes should be unnecessary. If this is not the case, the <a>WG</a> should revert the <a>Draft</a> to an earlier versioning milestone.

      A <strong>0.9</strong> <a>Draft</a> document is technically stable. No changes should be expected at this point, and all editor reviews are completed.
