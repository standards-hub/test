## FinOps FOCUS Workflow Overview

Our workflow is divided into several stages with different roles involved:

1. **Triage:** WG (Working Group) Members generate issues and PRs (Pull Requests), which go for triage.
2. **Work In Progress:** Post triage, tasks are categorized into Task Force 1 and Task Force 2 for discussion and development.
3. **Parking Lot:** In case of any qualms or queries, issues/PRs are moved to the Parking Lot.
4. **Review & Approval:** The WG Members send the issues/PRs for WG approval and may require re-evaluation.
5. **Merged or Closed:** Finally, PRs are either merged or closed based on the approval process.

### Roles & Stages

- **WG Members:** Responsible for generating issues/PRs and approving them in the Review & Approval stage.
- **Maintainers:** Facilitate the triage process and re-evaluation before sending items for WG approval.
- **Task Forces:** Engage in discussion and development of issues/PRs post triage.

### GitHub Workflow

- **Generate Issues / PRs:** Start by creating an issue or PR for a new feature, improvement, or bug fix.
- **Triage:** A maintainer will review the submission and either move it to a Task Force for further work or to the Parking Lot if it requires more discussion.
- **Discussion & Development:** The Task Forces will discuss and develop the solutions, keeping in mind the feedback from the triage.
- **Approval:** Once development is complete, the item is sent back to WG Members for final review and approval.
- **Merge or Close:** Based on the final review, the issue/PR will be merged into the main branch or closed if it does not meet the requirements.
