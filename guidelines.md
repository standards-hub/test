## Technical Specifications Life-Cycle


## Specification Development
Sandwiched between the "Work Item" initiation and the "Consistency Review", the "Specification Development" phase encapsulates the entire GitHub-driven workflow. It represents a significant phase in the specification life-cycle where the proposed items are fleshed out, debated, refined and approved until they are ready for the final consistency check, ensuring alignment with the overarching goals and existing standards.

This diagram phase serves as a roadmap for standards engineers, providing a clear and organized path from the creation of items (Issues and Pull Requests) to its final review and approval. It emphasizes the collaborative nature of the process and the critical role of consensus in developing robust, widely-accepted standards.

The diagram maps the workflow of specification development, particularly in the context of a GitHub implementation for standards engineers. It outlines a structured approach to progressing from the initial concept of a work item to the final consistency review, framed within both consensus stages and GitHub Workflow.

Here's a detailed description of the diagram:

### Consensus Process

The development of standards within any organization is a meticulous process that requires a structured approach to ensure broad agreement and quality outcomes. The consensus stages described here outline the essential steps taken by standards organizations to reach an agreement on various specifications and changes. This content serves to elucidate the inner workings of these stages, providing clarity on how consensus is achieved in a systematic and inclusive manner. In the following section, we will explore how these consensus stages are practically applied using a GitHub Project workflow, demonstrating a real-world process of collaboration and decision-making. This implementation is not only practical but also aligns with contemporary methods of software development and project management, thus exemplifying a modern approach to standards development. These are the consensus stages:

#### Creation:
In the initial "Creation" stage, Working Group (WG) members initiate the process by generating issues and pull requests (PRs) against a specific release. This marks the conceptual inception of new features and signifies the beginning of the specification development process.

#### Discussion:
Subsequently, the "Discussion" stage provides a platform for dynamic engagement among maintainers and WG members. Through the collaborative examination and enhancement of ideas, this phase ensures that issues are fully vetted and, if meritorious, transformed into actionable Pull Requests.

#### Review & Approval:
As we progress to the "Review & Approval" stage, there is a shift to meticulous scrutiny by WG members. It is here that the proposals are subjected to a thorough review, ensuring they meet the organization's exacting standards for approval.

#### Merged or Closed:
Finally, we reach the decisive point of the consensus stages. In "Merged or Closed," the fate of each PR is determined: those that achieve approval are merged, signaling the successful addition of a new or improved feature to the standard. Those that fail to meet the consensus Approval Criteria are closed, thus concluding their journey without integration. This stage marks the resolution of the consensus process and sets the stage for the next cycle of development and improvement.

### GitHub Project Workflow
These are the Project Workflow status:

#### Triage: 
As the inception point within the GitHub environment, items are initially triaged by maintainers. This sorting process is essential for prioritizing tasks and streamlining the workflow.

#### Parking Lot: 
Identified by the qualifier "In & Out," this stage serves as a temporary hold for items that, while acknowledged as important, are not immediately actionable. The work on these items is paused, often due to external dependencies or strategic considerations.

#### Work in Progress: 
Task forces come into play, getting into active discussions on the items assigned to the Task Force. It's a hive of collaborative effort, where the groundwork for the specifications is laid out and iteratively refined.

#### Review & Approval: 
Post-discussion, items deemed technically complete are forwarded to the WG for final approval. This is a critical gatekeeping phase where standards are scrutinized before formal adoption.

#### Merged or Closed:
The process concludes with the merging of agreed-upon PRs. Alternatively, issues that garner consensus may be transitioned into PRs for integration. Some items may be closed if the WG decides no action is necessary.
