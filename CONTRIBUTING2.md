# Contributing to FOCUS Group Projects

Welcome to the FOCUS Group's Specification Development Workflow! This document outlines the process that the FOCUS Group follows using GitHub Projects to create, discuss, approve, and integrate items such as Issues and Pull Requests (PRs) into our specifications.

## Workflow Overview

Our workflow is divided into distinct stages, each with its own set of activities and objectives:

### 1. Creation
- **What Happens Here:** WG Members generate Issues and PRs against a particular release.
- **Your Role:** As a contributor, you can propose new features or report bugs by creating an issue. If you have a fix or a new feature implementation ready, you can create a PR.

### 2. Triage
- **What Happens Here:** Issues and PRs are triaged by maintainers to assess their impact, urgency, and validity.
- **Your Role:** You may be asked for further information to clarify your submitted Issues/PRs. Be responsive to comments to ensure your contributions are considered for the next stages.

### 3. Parking Lot (Qualifiers)
- **What Happens Here:** Items that are recognized as valuable but are not immediately actionable are placed in the Parking Lot.
- **Your Role:** If your issue is placed here, it is acknowledged but will not be actively worked on immediately. Patience is appreciated.

### 4. Discussion
- **What Happens Here:** Maintainers and WG members discuss the details of Issues and PRs, with a focus on understanding the problem and exploring solutions.
- **Your Role:** Engage in the conversation, defend your point of view, provide additional information, and be open to feedback and alternative ideas.

### 5. Work In Progress
- **What Happens Here:** Task Forces discuss and actively work on the items, iterating over the proposed changes.
- **Your Role:** If your contribution has moved on to this stage, actively participate in the ongoing discussions and revisions.

### 6. Review & Approval
- **What Happens Here:** WG members rigorously review the items to ensure they meet the high standards of the group.
- **Your Role:** Respond promptly to review comments, make necessary revisions, and update your PR as needed.

### 7. Merged or Closed
- **What Happens Here:** Approved PRs are merged into the baseline, marking the successful incorporation of the contribution. Those not meeting the approval criteria are closed.
- **Your Role:** Celebrate if your contribution is merged! If it's closed, understand the reasoning, and use the experience to guide future contributions.

## Contributing Steps

1. **Check Existing Items:** Before creating a new Issue or PR, please check to see if an existing item already addresses your concern or contribution.

2. **Create an Issue/PR:** If no existing item covers your contribution, follow the template provided to create a new Issue or PR.

3. **Engage in Discussion:** Actively participate in the discussion regarding your Issue or PR, providing clarifications, and updates as needed.

4. **Implement Changes:** For PRs, work on your code changes in your forked repository and push updates to the PR as the discussion evolves.

5. **Follow Through:** Keep track of your Issue/PR as it moves through the stages. Address any triage or review feedback.

## Final Notes

- **Patience is Key:** The specification development process is thorough and can take time. Please be patient as the WG and community work through the stages.
- **Feedback is a Gift:** Whether positive or negative, feedback is an opportunity to improve. Embrace it.
