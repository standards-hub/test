## Workflow Overview

Our workflow is divided into distinct stages, each with its own set of activities and objectives:

### 1. Creation & Triaged:
- **What Happens Here:** 
* WG Members generate Issues and PRs against a particular feature and for a specific release.
* Issues and PRs are triaged by Maintainers to assess their impact, urgency, and validity. Maintainers decide if the Item is assigned a Task Force or temporarily place the Item in the Parking Lot.
- **Your Role:** As a contributor, you can propose new features or report bugs by creating an Issue. If you have a fix or a new feature implementation ready, you may create a PR. Assign Project and Items labels as you see fit. 
* You may be asked for further information to clarify your submitted Issues/PRs. Be responsive to comments to ensure your contributions are considered for the next stages.

>The Maintainers and the Group may change the Item labels a later stage.
>Check with the Maintainers before directly creating a PR.

**Parking Lot**
- **What Happens Here:** Items that are recognized as valuable but are not immediately actionable are placed in the Parking Lot.
- **Your Role:** If your issue is placed here, it is acknowledged but will not be actively worked on immediately. Patience is appreciated. Engage in the conversation, defend your point of view, provide additional information, and be open to feedback and alternative ideas.

>Check the labels assigned to the Item. These labels qualifies the Item for a later discussion.

### 2. Work In Progress
- **What Happens Here:** Task Forces discuss the details of Issues and PRs, with a focus on understanding the problem and exploring solutions. 
- **Your Role:** If your contribution has moved on to this stage, actively participate in the ongoing discussions and revisions.

>In this stage the group will assigned labels that identify the Approval Criteria for how the Item will be evaluated.

### 3. Review & Approval
- **What Happens Here:** Upon completion of Work In Progress phase, the Maintainers will move the Items to the Review & Approval phase. WG members rigorously review the items to ensure they meet the high standards of the group.
- **Your Role:** Respond promptly to review comments, make necessary revisions, and update your PR as needed.

>The number of days under review and the criteria for approval is indicated in the labels prefix with `r&a - X review days + Y Member Ok's + Z Maintainer Ok's + no objections`

### 4. Merged or Closed
- **What Happens Here:** Approved PRs are merged into the baseline, marking the successful incorporation of the contribution. Those not meeting the approval criteria are closed.
- **Your Role:** Celebrate if your contribution is merged! If it's closed, understand the reasoning, and use the experience to guide future contributions.

## Contributing Steps

1. **Check Existing Items:** Before creating a new Issue or PR, please check to see if an existing Item already addresses your concern or contribution.

2. **Create an Issue/PR:** If no existing Item covers your contribution, follow the template provided to create a new Issue or PR.
>Check the Task Force Convener or Maintainers before creating directly a PR.
>Make sure that you qualify your Item by assigning relevant levels.

3. **Engage in Discussion:** Actively participate in the Task Force discussions regarding your Issue or PR, providing clarifications, and updates as needed.

4. **Implement Changes:** For PRs, work on your statements changes in your assigned branch and push updates to the PR as the discussion evolves.

5. **Follow Through:** Keep track of your Issue/PR as it moves through the stages. Address any triage or review feedback.

## Final Notes

- **Patience is Key:** The specification development process is thorough and can take time. Please be patient as the WG and community work through the stages.
- **Feedback is a Gift:** Whether positive or negative, feedback is an opportunity to improve. Embrace it.
