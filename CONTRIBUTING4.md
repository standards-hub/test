## Workflow Overview

Our workflow is structured into stages, each with specific activities and objectives:

### 1. Creation & Triage:
- **Activities:** WG members create issues and PRs for specific features and releases. Maintainers triage these to evaluate impact, urgency, and validity, deciding whether to assign a Task Force or place them in the Parking Lot.
- **Your Role:** Propose features or report bugs through issues. For fixes or new features, create a PR. Be prepared to provide additional information and respond to comments.
>The Maintainers and the Group may change the Item labels a later stage.
>Check with the Maintainers before directly creating a PR.

   **Parking Lot**:
    - **Activities:** Valuable but not immediately actionable items are placed here.
    - **Your Role:** Engagement and patience are key. Defend your viewpoint, provide further information, and remain open to feedback. The group will eventually process the item.
>Check the labels assigned to the item this may give you clues why it has been placed temporarily in the Parking Lot.

### 2. Work In Progress
- **Activities:** Task Forces discuss the details of Issues and PRs, with a focus on understanding the problem and exploring solutions.
- **Your Role:**  If your contribution has moved on to this stage, actively participate in the ongoing discussions and revisions.
>In this stage the group will assigned labels that identify the Approval Criteria for how the Item will be evaluated.

### 3. Review & Approval
- **Activities:** After the Work In Progress phase, items move to Review & Approval, where WG members ensure they meet the group's standards.
- **Your Role:** Promptly address review comments, revise your contributions, and update your PR as necessary.
>The number of days under review and the criteria for approval is indicated in the labels prefix with e.g., `r&a - X review days + Y Member Ok's + Z Maintainer Ok's + no objections`

### 4. Merged or Closed
- **Activities:** Approved PRs are merged into the baseline, marking the successful incorporation of the contribution. Those not meeting the approval criteria are closed. Agree Issues are converted into Pull Requests.
- **Your Role:** Celebrate if your contribution is merged! If it's closed, understand the reasoning, and use the experience to guide future contributions.

## Contributing Steps

1. **Check Existing Items:** Verify if your concern or contribution is already addressed.
2. **Create an Issue/PR:** If no existing Item covers your contribution, follow the template provided to create a new Issue or PR.

>Check the Task Force Convener or Maintainers before creating directly a PR. Make sure that you qualify your Item by assigning relevant levels.

3. **Engage in Discussion:** Actively participate in the Task Force discussions regarding your Issue or PR, providing clarifications, and updates as needed.
4. **Implement Changes:** For PRs, work on your statements changes in your assigned branch and push updates to the PR as the discussion evolves.
5. **Follow Through:** Keep track of your Issue/PR as it moves through the stages. Address any triage or review feedback.

## Final Notes

- **Patience is Key:** The specification development process is thorough and can take time. Please be patient as the WG and community work through the stages.
- **Feedback is a Gift:** Whether positive or negative, feedback is an opportunity to improve. Embrace it.
